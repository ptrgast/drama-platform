# Drama Platform

The Drama Platform allows you to create animated stories for the web by utilizing the canvas and the audio elements that were introduced by HTML5.

## Examples

You can find an example story here http://ptrgast.com/drama/.

## Development Prerequisites

The Drama Platform scripts are divided in multiple files to ease the development process. In order to make changes to the source you will need the following tools:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) Actually you will need *npm* that is bundled with Node.js
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) Which is used to link all the different script files of the project
- [Watchify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/watchify) This is optional but it will make your life easier as it will automatically rebuild the final files when a change has been detected.
